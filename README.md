# Global-GBS-Benchmarking-Diagnostic-Research-System
A complete end-to-end project demonstrating benchmarking, diagnostic analysis, survey methodology, statistical modeling, and automation — aligned with responsibilities of a Benchmarking &amp; Diagnostic Specialist.

## Project Overview
This project simulates the work done inside a Benchmarking & Diagnostic Center of Excellence (CoE): collecting primary data, cleaning and managing datasets, building benchmarking models, performing diagnostic analysis, and generating executive-ready insights.
It uses synthetic benchmarking & survey-like data to replicate the workflow used by global research organizations for evaluating GBS (Global Business Services) performance, maturity, digital adoption, and operational efficiency.
The project demonstrates:
- Survey & sampling methodology design
- Data management of complex, disparate datasets
- Descriptive + inferential statistical analysis
- Benchmarking scorecard creation
- Diagnostic maturity assessment frameworks
- Visualization & insights for senior executives
- Automation using Python

## Key Features
1. Primary Data Simulation
  A synthetic dataset is created to mirror real GBS benchmarking data:
  - Organizational model
  - GBS maturity levels
  - Operating KPIs (cycle time, cost, SLA performance)
  - Automation & digital adoption
  - Workforce & talent metrics
  - Customer satisfaction scores

2. Data Management & Quality
  The project demonstrates:
  - Data validation checks
  - Handling missing values
  - Outlier detection
  - Codebook and variable definitions
  - Merging disparate operational + maturity datasets
  - Recreating real-world research data workflows
    
3. Benchmarking Engine
  A simple but realistic benchmarking module that:
  - Computes percentile rankings (25th, 50th, 75th, 90th)
  - Compares organizations to industry peers
  - Creates benchmarking scorecards
  - Normalizes and scales KPIs for cross-company comparison
    
4. Diagnostic Maturity Model
  A 4-pillar GBS maturity framework:
  - Strategy & Governance
  - Process & Operations
  - Digital & Technology
  - Talent & Capabilities
    
  Outputs include:
  - Maturity scores
  - Strength/weakness radar charts
  - Cluster-based segmentation
    
5. Statistical Analysis
  Implements both descriptive and inferential techniques:
  - Correlation analysis
  - Regression modeling (e.g., drivers of maturity or performance)
  - Clustering for segmentation
  - Variance analysis
    
6. Executive Insights Deliverable
  Includes:
  - Power BI-style insight generation (Python visualizations)
  - Executive summary notebook
  - Recommendations based on diagnostic output

7. Automation Scripts (Python)
  Automation to:
  - Generate recurring benchmarking reports
  - Auto-create diagnostic dashboards
  - Batch-run statistical models

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, scipy)
- Power BI style visualization via Python
- Survey & sampling methodology principles
- Statistical modeling techniques
- Automation scripting


## Project Workflow
1. Data Simulation & Codebook Creation
- Synthetic dataset generated with realistic KPI ranges and business logic.
  
2. Data Cleaning & Quality Check
- Missing values, outliers, distributions.
  
3. Descriptive Analysis
- Summary statistics, correlations, distributions.
  
4. Inferential Statistical Modeling
- Regression + clustering.
  
5. Benchmarking Engine
- Percentile calculations and comparative scorecards.
  
6. Diagnostic Maturity Assessment
- 4-pillar scoring model and radar charts.
  
7. Executive Insights
- Recommendations and insights written in business language.
